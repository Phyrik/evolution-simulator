# evolution-simulator

A simple simulator to give a basic introduction and understanding of evolution.

Each pink circle is a creature. The red circle around it represents its vision distance. This determines how far it can move each turn, it moves to the closest food each turn. The blue circle represents the eating distance. This determines how close a piece of food needs to be for the creture to be able to eat it.
